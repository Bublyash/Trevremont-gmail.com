{"domain":"code.google.com","name":"hg4j","summary":"Pure Java API and Toolkit for Mercurial DVCS","description":"**Hg4J** is pure Java library that provides an API to access [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) repositories and a toolkit to solve some common tasks. Now it focuses on read-only operations, with few write operations added in 1.1, and eventually complete support for the Mercurial DVCS will be added.\n\nPrimary benefit of using **Hg4J** is that Python installation is no longer needed to access a Mercurial repository from your Java application, which is especially important for web applications within Java web servers or any other restricted environment. It\u0027s small, it\u0027s fast and (hopefully) easy to use.\n\nAt the moment, please find more details on this project and its licensing policy at http://hg4j.com/ web site.\n\nJoin users discussion group (subscribe to the mailing list) at [hg4j-users](http://lists.tmatesoft.com/mailman/listinfo/hg4j-users)\n\n_**LATEST:**_ 1.1 Release is available","stars":24,"license":"gpl2","contentLicense":"","labels":["Hg","Mercurial","DVCS","Java","VCS","Library"],"creationTime":0,"repoType":"hg","subrepos":["samples"],"hasSource":true,"ancestorRepo":"","logoName":"","movedTo":""}
